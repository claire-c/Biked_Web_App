# Biked: A Ruby Web Application

## Project Objectives

After four weeks of learning to program at CodeClan, I was tasked with consolidating my learnings in:
- OOP (specifically Ruby)
- TDD
- Databases and CRUD actions
- RESTful routes and MVC via the use of Sinatra

I decided to set my own brief and build a cycle-ride tracking application, Biked.

See the application deployed on Heroku - http://clairesfirstproject.herokuapp.com/

## Project Brief

You want to start tracking your cycling and the famous Scottish cycle routes you have travelled. You have decided to make a cycling app to help you see how much you're cycling and the routes you have done.

### MVP:

- CRUD actions for users
- CRUD actions for routes
- CRUD actions for rides
- Each user should have a list of the routes they have cycled
- Each route should have a list of the users that have cycled it
- Each user should be able to see:
  - total number of miles cycled
  - total climb (elevation)
  - total number of routes cycled

### Extensions:

- Each user has a profile page
- Each route has an info page
- Each bike ride has an info page
- Have a leaderboard

## Design Process

Before any coding, I started with UX processes, including personas, user journeys and user stories. I followed this with UML diagrams and database modelling. With all preparatory work undertaken in one day, I spent three days building Ruby functionality and the Sinatra MVC. The remaining three days were spent learning and implementing CSS (specifically Flexbox). I wireframed every route of the website to help with CSS and website construction.

To keep myself on track I used several organisational tools, including a Trello board and the old-fashioned analogue to-do list.

## If I had more time

I would have loved to build additional functionality in Ruby, namely:

- User can view their cycling activities by month
- User can create goals for their cycling activity
- Users can be part of a cycling club

I would also like to have made my Ruby functions more robust to account for more edge cases.

## What I learned

While I enjoyed building all of this project and felt it was a great way to consolidate my learnings, my favourite part of the process was building the models and controller. I enjoyed problem-solving and working with Ruby to help realise the brief.

I was surprised how much CSS I was able to learn over three days. This was mostly solo learning, with some support from fellow CodeClanners if I got properly stuck. Flexbox in particular was an interesting learning curve - it took me two days to feel comfortable working with it. However, I now have a responsive website which is a great outcome.

I feel the best way for me to learn is to actually build and get stuck into projects.
